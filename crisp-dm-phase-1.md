# CRISP-DM Phase 1: Business Understanding
## SINASC Dataset - Live Birth Information System

### 1.1 Business Context

The Live Birth Information System (SINASC - Sistema de Informações sobre Nascidos Vivos) represents one of Brazil's primary epidemiological data sources, operating officially since 1990. This system was developed by the Ministry of Health with the strategic purpose of collecting, processing, and disseminating information about births throughout the national territory.

**System Characteristics:**
- **Coverage**: National, covering all Brazilian states and municipalities
- **Implementation**: Gradual since 1990, with consolidation from 1994 onwards
- **Reliability**: Presents, in many municipalities, more complete records than IBGE data based on civil registry offices
- **Integration**: Provides data for all levels of the Unified Health System (SUS)

### 1.2 Business Objectives

SINASC was designed to meet multiple strategic objectives in the public health area:

#### Primary Objectives:
- **Natality Monitoring**: Track demographic trends and birth patterns
- **Epidemiological Surveillance**: Identify risk factors and maternal-child health indicators
- **Management Support**: Provide data for planning and evaluation of public health policies

#### Secondary Objectives:
- **Program Evaluation**: Measure effectiveness of maternal-child health interventions
- **Scientific Research**: Support epidemiological and public health studies
- **Public Transparency**: Make information available to civil society and researchers

### 1.3 Relevance for Data Analysis

The SINASC dataset stands out for its unique characteristics:

**Strengths:**
- **Data Volume**: Millions of annual records covering births throughout the country
- **Variable Richness**: Detailed information about mother, pregnancy, delivery, and newborn
- **Longitudinal History**: Over 30 years of consistent data
- **Standardization**: Nationally uniform structure

**Analytical Potential:**
- Identification of temporal and seasonal birth patterns
- Analysis of socioeconomic and demographic factors
- Studies of correlation between maternal-child health variables
- Development of predictive models for health indicators

### 1.4 Strategic Importance

Birth monitoring transcends simple statistical collection, constituting a fundamental tool for:

- **Health Surveillance**: Early detection of public health problems
- **Resource Planning**: Sizing needs in maternal-child health
- **Policy Evaluation**: Measuring the impact of government programs
- **Scientific Research**: Basis for high-quality epidemiological studies

### 1.5 Potential Research Questions

Based on SINASC characteristics, some relevant questions for analysis include:

- Which factors are associated with better perinatal outcomes?
- How do socioeconomic variables influence maternal-child health indicators?
- Are there geographic or temporal patterns in birth data?
- Is it possible to develop predictive models for identifying high-risk pregnancies?

### 1.6 Analysis Scope Delimitation

For this specific study, a temporal and geographic subset of SINASC data will be analyzed:

**Temporal Scope:**
- **Analysis year**: 2022
- **Justification**: Most recent available data, allowing current analysis of maternal-child health situation

**Geographic Scope:**
- **State**: Paraíba
- **Justification**: Regional focus allows more detailed and specific analysis of local characteristics, considering socioeconomic and demographic particularities of the state

**Advantages of this Delimitation:**
- **Homogeneity**: Reduces variability related to extreme regional differences
- **Depth**: Allows more detailed analysis of Paraíba's specific characteristics
- **Feasibility**: More manageable data volume for exploratory analysis
- **Local Relevance**: Results may have more direct practical application for state policies

**Assumed Limitations:**
- Results may not be generalizable to other states
- Temporal analysis limited to a single year
- Impossibility of identifying longitudinal trends
